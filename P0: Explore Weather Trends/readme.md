# Project - Weather Data

Who doesn't want to know the weather? [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/) provides weather data for areas across the world.


## Project Overview

In this project we'll be using sample weather data for the month of May from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/). We are interested in querying the data to answer various questions. We'll specifically look at:

* Max temperature on foggy and non-foggy days
* Number of rainy days
* Average temperature on the weekends
* Average temperatures on rainy days where the minimum temperature is greater then 55
