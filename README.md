Projects for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

### P0: Explore Weather Trends

An opportunity to get started with data analysis and receive some quick feedback about your progress.

Set up iPython notebook and commonly used data analysis libraries on your own computer. Use them to dig into the results of an experiment testing the optimal length of chopsticks and present your findings.

### P1: Investigate the Dataset

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give your readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.

### P3: Design an A/B Test

Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.

### P4: Vizualizing the Prosper Loan Dataset

Use Pandas and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.
